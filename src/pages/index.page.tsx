          Pokkit Auth is an opinionated wrapper around PocketBase functionality that builds on the
          solid work the PocketBase maintainers have done. By stripping out non-authentication
          features, Pokkit Auth shows how accessible and powerful PocketBase can be when tailored to
          standard development workflows.

          This project continues PocketBase's approach of providing a genuinely open source solution
          that keeps control with developers. Building on PocketBase's strong foundation, we can
          offer something that's easy to use and maintain, without paid subscriptions or dependence
          on big companies that might change their pricing. The maintainers have made it possible to
          get up and running quickly without the trade-offs you see in some open-source
          alternatives.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Most importantly, Pokkit Auth is designed to help the maintainers by handling UI-related
          requests, letting them focus on the core functionality that makes PocketBase great. This
          respects what they're already doing well and supports their work on the project.

          At this time we are working on Pokkit Auth "core". This merely exposes existing pocketbase
          functionality, but we would like to add more features and functionality over time. The
          roadmap includes:
